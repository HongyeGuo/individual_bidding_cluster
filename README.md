# individual_bidding_cluster
### Abstract
The repository is used to cluster individual bidding behaviors as typical patterns shown in paper [1].  
However, the code is currently used for personal academic using. 
The codes will be still modified and adjusted. The author cannot ensure there is no bug.  
If you find any bug or have comments for me, be welcome to contact me at hyguo@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn

### Use Guides
The main code is named as 'demo.py', which uses several functions to cluster raw bidding data as typical patterns.  
The raw bidding data are stored in 'data' folder. Here has been several example files in this folder.  
The output of the algorithm, which is the clustering results, will be stored in "result" folder.

### Applications
The code can be used for academic using. If it has some helps for your research, you can quote the paper [1].  
The code has already been used in paper [2].
